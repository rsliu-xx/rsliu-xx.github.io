## Short Bio

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at [Harada Lab.](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/), in [Osaka Unversity](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/ja), supervised by Professor [Harada Kensuke](http://www.hlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/harada/) and Professor [Wan Weiwei](https://wanweiwei07.github.io/). My research interest is robotic manipulation. I received my M.E. from Nanyang Technologic University and B.E. from Tianjin University, China.

## Research Interest
My major interest is robotic manipulation, which include grasping planning, motion planning, and other low level and high level task planning algorithms. I am also studying visual perception, image processing and force control to enhance the robotic manipulation system.

        <p>This video shows a flexible and robust robotic system for autonomous drawing on 3D surfaces. The system maps the strokes onto the surface and generates robot motion using visual recognition, grasp pose reasoning, and motion planning. Unlike conventional systems, the robot can recognize and pick up pens to draw 3D strokes, making it more flexible. The system's robustness is ensured by minimizing deformation in the strokes, re-estimating the drawing tool's pose, employing force control, and implementing error detection and recovery. The planning and executions are performed in a closed-loop manner. </p>

        <p>This video presents a combined task and motion planner for a combined task and motion planner (TAMP) for a robot arm to work with a bending machine in 3D metal wire curving tasks commonly found in manufacturing and medical fields. Our method converts a 3D curve to a bending set and generates the feasible bending sequence, machine usage, robotic grasp poses, and pick-and-place arm motion considering the combined task and motion level constraints. Compared with previous deformable linear object shaping work that relied on forces provided by robotic arms, the proposed method is suitable for the material with high stiffness. </p>
