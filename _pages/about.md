### Short Bio

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate at [Harada Lab.](https://www.roboticmanipulation.org/), in [Osaka Unversity](https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/ja), supervised by Professor [Harada Kensuke](http://www.hlab.sys.es.osaka-u.ac.jp/people/harada/) and Professor [Wan Weiwei](https://wanweiwei07.github.io/). My research interest is robotic manipulation. I received my M.E. from Nanyang Technologic University and B.E. from Tianjin University, China.

### Research Interest
My major interest is robotic manipulation, which include grasping planning, motion planning, and other low level and high level task planning algorithms. I am also studying visual perception, image processing and force control to enhance the robotic manipulation system.
